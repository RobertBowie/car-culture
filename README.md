# car-culture
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta).  

## Product Summary ##
  > CÂ² answers the question 'What next?'.  You tell the app a bit about your car and the app digs through
our database of user experiences for the next major issues (or upgrades!) you should watch out for.  The more users
that are a part of Car Culture the more reliable and comprehensive our information becomes.

This was a solo project, designed to excercise the ability to realistically scope and develop with a tight deadline.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Car Culture ##
  > Also known as C².

## Market ##
  > An app for any car enthusiast looking for reliable, real world info on their vehicle.

## Summary ##
  > C² answers the question 'What next?'.  You tell the app a bit about your car and the app digs through
our database of user experiences for the next major issues (or upgrades!) you should watch out for.  The more users
that are a part of Car Culture the more reliable and comprehensive our information becomes.

## Problem ##
  > Much of car maintenance is based on factory recommendation or a shop telling you that it would be in
your best interest to take care of some work preemptively.  The rest of the time we only fix things
as they break.  C² will allow the user to make an informed decision based on other car owners that
care about their rides, rather than having to trust a shop or a manufacturer's (possibly biased)
recommendation.

## Solution ##
  > C² only asks for basic car info and immediately gives you important warnings and optional
suggestions for keeping your car healthy.

## Quote from the Company ##

## How to Get Started ##

## Customer Quote ##
  > "This app is great!  I was just going to check out upgrades until I found out that my timing belt commonly breaks in the next 5k
miles and got in to a trusted local shop immediately, saving myself from a potential full engine replacement others had to deal with."
